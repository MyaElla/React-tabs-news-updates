### - complete setting up request file ( move fetchSectionContents() inside; update headers for 403 on [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) )
### - try test with Cypress
### - prep for production ( build, minify..?) > When youâ€™re [ready to deploy to production](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/production-build) , create a minified bundle with 'npm run build'. 
### - style tabs
### - style article links 
### - try tabs created from scratch (add activetab prop/ onchange?)
